# <center>CV Website: Terry Downie**</center>


View the live site [here](https://trdownie.github.io/ucd-cv-website/).

This website is the live CV of myself, [Terry Downie](https://github.com/trdownie). It is responsive, therefore accessible on a range of devices. The purpose of this site is to secure employment and seek collaboration. This website also forms part of my diploma in Full Stack Development with the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), specifically user-centric frontend development. As such, this site has been developed strictly using HTML5 and CSS3.

## <center>User Experience (UX)</center>

-----------------------------

The design of the site began with target user objectives in mind and worked up from there. The process is detailed here.

### **User Stories**

The **primary users** of this site will be **employers** and **recruiters**. They will want:
1.	To be able to easily navigate around the site.
2.	To understand immediately and with definitive clarity the purpose of the site and its relevance to them in their search for talent.
3.	To get a glimpse of my personality and what I can bring to the table.
4.	To obtain key information about me, specifically:
    - My education/work history.
    - My current skillset with competence levels where applicable.
    - The projects I have worked on.
5.	To be able to contact me in their preferred manner.
6.	To be able to download a copy of my CV to share with their organisation or network.

The **secondary users** of this site will be potential **collaborators**. They will want:
1.	To be able to easily navigate around the site.
2.	To understand immediately and with definitive clarity the purpose of the site and its relevance to them in their search for collaborators.
3.	To get a glimpse of my personality and what my values are.
4.	To obtain key information about me, specifically:
    - My current skillset with competence levels where applicable.
    - The projects I have worked on and the briefs I have worked to in these projects.
5.	To be able to contact me in their preferred manner.

**Return visitors** will want to:
1.	Quickly locate and view my updated projects.
2.	Quickly assess my competence levels in key areas.

### **Design**

#### *Strategy*
The **strategy** of the website must be focused on meeting the needs of the users outlined above. Anything superfluous to that may be to the detriment of user experience more than to its benefit, and due to the narrow focus of this project any additional considerations are not a priority.

The **primary goal** of this website is to convey all of the information that meets the needs of the respective users in the optimal way. To do this, the main focus must be on a clean aesthetic, a well organised and logical flow of information, and a minimalistic design. These areas will ensure the user experience is optimum, and that using the site creates no additional information overload, something that is a common issue among professionals and will likely be expounded by scrolling CV’s all day, in the case of these users. In short, the goal is to provide the users everything that want in a familiar way, and nothing they don’t want.

The **secondary goal** of this website is to balance good design principles with professionalism and my own unique personality. Design includes the proper consideration of stylistic elements such as colour, imagery and typography, as well as the layout and flow of information. Professionalism overlaps the design, but also includes the key messages, the personality infused into the copy, and the tone of voice. Finding the balance between these two will ensure users understand that I am capable of following the established design conventions of the field, while also infusing my own blend of professionalism and personality into the project. This is essential for clients and end users for many B2B projects; therefore, this secondary goal complements the first goal nicely.

#### *Scope*
The scope is to achieve the strategic objectives outlined above. The most practical way to serve this end it to present a single flow of information that users can follow to achieve their respective list of information needs. Any detour from this single flow of information will only complicate the channel between the site and the user that information must flow through, therefore inhibiting the project’s success.

The **main scope considerations** are:
- The site will be a single continuous website with clean and logical flow of information.
- The landing page will display to our target users that this site is exactly what they are looking for.
- There must be four informational areas:
    - About me, conveying value to the users without too much information
    - Work/education history, in an easily accessible and logical way
    - Skills, including my level of competence for specific skills, and in the order of competence for return users
    - Projects, with the most recent projects at the top to accommodate return visitors
- There must be a means to contact me, and the barriers to contact must be reduced as much as possible.

The **content considerations** are:
- The website is informational; therefore, it will be predominantly text-based.
- An image, or perhaps a short GIF, of me on the landing page will add a face to the content.
- Icons will utilise the metaphorical nature of human thinking and break up the dense swathes of information.
- Each section will utilise quirky information presentation tools such as timelines, boxes or bar charts to maximise engagement.

#### *Structure*
The design of CV websites is inevitably contradictory; conventional sectioning helps greatly in providing the required information in the most proficient way, but there is a requirement to ‘stand out’ which calls for breaking pure convention. Considering this, and also taking into consideration the scope, strategy and user goals, it made sense to provide the information in a conventional and minimalistic format with a slight deviation from the norm early on grab the users attention before providing the required information in a reliable and conventional way.

The **website structure**, in order, has eight parts:
1.	*Navigation Bar*: A narrow and minimalistic menu navigation with social media links
2.	*Landing Page*: including,
    - A welcome message
    - A reassurance that the website is what the user is looking for
    - An image of me
    - Something to add flare that makes the user want to continue
3.	*Pitch*: a combination of my personal bio and what I can offer users, in the form of an elevator pitch with 3-5 sentences
4.	*History*: a chronological outline of my work/employment history
5.	*Skills*: an outline of my key skills, the programming languages I know and how well I can use them, and the relevant tools I can use
6.	*Projects*: a list of projects, both completed and in progress, with the most recent at the top for return users
7.	*Contact*: a contact form, alongside other means of contact, and a downloadable CV for primary users
8.	*Footer*: a basic footer bar with any copyright details on for completeness

**Information flow** for the website is a consistent and single flow of information from landing page to contact. The idea is to give the users all of the information they need so that can make an informed decision as to whether to contact me. In selling, this is overcoming objections. Ultimately, by the time users arrive at my contact form, they should know whether I meet their requirements for a potential employee or collaborator and want to discuss next steps with me if I meet these requirements.

**Navigation** for the website factors in my desired information flow, while also recognising that users may only want a specific section of the information on display. As such, there are three potential ways to navigate the site. They are:
- *Preferred*: Each section will have a down arrow that users will be enticed to click on to maximise engagement and the overcoming of objections mentioned above. The last section will have an up arrow allowing users to return to the top.
- *Preferred*: The pitch section will have a CTA for users to jump ahead and contact me at that point. While this can lead to a reduced quality in the contacts provided, I feel this trade-off is acceptable to achieve two things: a combination of benefit statements and CTA’s is a powerful way to engage with an audience, and a certain subsection of users may prefer direct contact and the two opening sections infused with personality may be sufficient for them to proceed, therefore this allows them the chance to do so.
- *Conventional*: A navigation menu along the top will allow users to jump to sections as they please. This is to play into familiarity, but it is not the preferred method of navigation as it means some information may be overlooked and not due to the reason above, specifically to contact me.

**Interaction** is minimal since HTML and CSS aren’t optimal languages for interaction and because interaction simply isn’t a necessity. The interactive elements sections are specifically aimed at reinforcing the single continuous flow of the site and are as follows:
- The down arrows and associated teaser text will grow on occasion prompting users to follow that method of navigation.
- The elevator icons in the pitch section will appear sequentially after 3-5 seconds to mimic an elevator going down.
- The text in the history section will appear sequentially to clarify the flow of information.

#### *Skeleton*
Initial sketches on paper led to the following **wireframes** being developed using Figma. These are intentionally basic as this should be a time-efficient stage, utilised simply to visualise the project before undertaking complete mockups, anticipate any hurdles, or spot the opportunity for additional features. The three main screen sizes have been visualised, with the initial wireframes being done on mobile and then converted up from there.

![A screenshot showing the website's black & white wireframes](/assets/readme-img/wireframes.png)

As you can see, the **layout** reinforces the objective of the site: to funnel users towards the ultimate CTA, to contact me. Each section is clearly defined and the site employs contrasting light and dark pages, a key design element which will be explored in the surface section.

The following **features** are on display here:
- *Landing Page*: Introductory text, welcome to the site and image of me
- *Pitch*: an elevator icon and 4 small chunks of text to add metaphorical value and break up the text
- *History*: icons for each of the roles I’ve had, again adding metaphorical value to help interpretation
- *Skills*: more icons, again adding metaphorical value, and a bar chart representing progress in a visually appealing and logical way
- *Projects*: screenshots of the projects so the user can see at a glance work that has been done.
- *Contact*: multiple ways to contact me – contact form, telephone number, email address and social media links
- *Contact*: a simple link to a downloadable PDF CV 

#### *Surface*
Following the wireframes, the final step of design was to create in-depth **mockups**. These were also created in Figma using the three main screen sizes.

![A screenshot showing the website's full mockups](/assets/readme-img/mockups.png)
 
Regarding **typography**, Montserrat and Roboto were used. These are two of my favourite fonts and both have relevance in programming, therefore making them appropriate. The main reason for using them, however, was how clean and crisp they are for presenting information, and how versatile they are, both having high readability even in all caps and with different weightings.

The **colour scheme** employed a dark and light theme with different contrasting accent colours to match. This was an interesting choice for me. It allowed each section to feel completely different from the previous one without using more than four colours, thus encouraging the preferred navigation method of ‘section-by-section’. The light grey/dark grey combination were chosen as pure black and white can appear harsh to some eyes on a screen, and the goal is to minimise friction at all costs. Additionally, grey is the colour of balance, professionality, and according to Nobel Prize-winning author Andre Gide: “The colour of truth is grey”. Grey can be seen as depressing, however, therefore adding two contrasting and vibrant hues, cyan and purple, eliminates this negative connotation and adds the necessary creativity for the secondary goal of the project.

As earlier mentioned, the **imagery** used here is minimal. The image on the landing page has been rendered in black & white with a circle of colour to match the aesthetic of the site. The icons chosen were minimalistic to convey meaning, not to add flare that can take a user’s attention from the message. The screenshots are also in black & white for consistency. 

The **copy** used follows the trend of minimal, purposeful and concise. Strunk’s “omit needles words” is still the perfect advice on copy from his The Elements of Style, a guide to copy from 1918 that is still as relevant today as ever. This has been the overarching theme of the site: by ensuring conciseness, the required information can be provided without anything superfluous. (This README could perhaps benefit from that seminal advice – but this is, of course, outlined in additional detail for assessment purposes.) Finally, the tone of voice is clear, confident and collaborative, while balancing to-the-point professionalism, such as “recent projects”, with personality, by using colloquialisms such as “let’s talk”.

-----------------------------

## <center>Features</center>

-----------------------------

The project is relatively light on features as dictated by what is necessary to achieve the goals of its target users. These are laid out here.

### **Core Features**
Three elements have been used throughout to maintain a consistent layout and support the user goal of being able to quickly access the information they require quickly.

The teaser button is used on each section (except the last section). As the last thing on each page, this prompts the user to click the arrow and follow the website in sequential order, which is my preferred navigation path for the user.

Each section has a heading that is short, sharp and concise, and balances professionalism with personality. This keeps things simple and immediately sets the scene for each section.

The nav menu is sticky, therefore travelling with the user as they explore each section. 

### **Header**
The header bar is transparent and changes colour to contrast against the background of the changing sections adding a touch of flare to the project. The section the user is currently on is highlighted in the relevant accent colour and also an underline. In addition, hovering over the words or icons will elicit a colour change in the respective accent colour, but the underline will remain only on the current section, allowing a distinction for user-friendliness.

The header is split into two sections: the social menu (left) and the nav menu (right).

The social menu contains the following social media links, in descending order of importance to users:
•	GitHub, where I share code
•	LinkedIn, my professional profile
•	Medium, where I write occasionally about technology
•	Twitter, where I post occasionally, sometimes about technology
•	Instagram, my personal profile

I considered removing these links as I don’t want to funnel users straight to my social media links on their arrival, and leave the links only on the last page, but I believe the benefit to repeat visitors outweighs this.

The nav menu contains the menu with six navigational links, which are intentionally concise:
•	Home
•	Pitch
•	History
•	Skills
•	Projects
•	Contact

### **Home**
The landing page (home) comprises of three unique elements: a welcome message, some brief information, and a photograph of me.

The welcome message is simple and concise: “welcome to my online CV”. 

The brief information consists of:
•	My name and what it is that I do, invaluable information for all target users.
•	My professional philosophy: “the simplest solution is the best solution”. This is included for three reasons. First, to showcase a little personality and grab the user’s attention. Second, to set the pace for the website, which is both simple but also a complete solution. Third, it alludes to the mathematical principle that the best solution to any mathematical problem is the simplest, allowing for both the maximum utility and minimum effort in using that solution in other mathematical problems. This final point is both a nod to my own background, but also a reminder to the keen reader that mathematics and computer programming logic share this core tenet, therefore subtly aligning my own strengths with the field in which I will work.
•	What I am seeking: employment and collaboration. By adding this front and centre there’s no ambiguity for any of the target users.

The photograph of me adds a face to the name, something non-essential, but nice to have. Humans enjoy dealing with humans.

The teaser used here is: “hear my pitch”. This should be exactly what primary users are looking for; therefore, this is a strong invitation to follow my preferred navigation system.

### **Pitch**
The elevator pitch comprises three unique elements: a heading, elevator icons, and some text.

The heading is clear and concise: “The elevator pitch.” This tells the user what is going on with the icons and informs them this will be a quick process therefore reducing the user’s desire to scroll.

The elevator icons reinforce the theme of this section in a metaphorical manner while also breaking up the text nicely. A ‘two-person’ elevator icon was chosed to subtly imply that I’m talking directly with the user one-on-one.

The text is broken into four sections, each section bringing its own punch:
1.	Education: this sets the stage by using words like “natural” and “proven”, which are confirmed in the next section where my degree is presented. It also uses “enhancing” for my tech skills, a subtle nod to the fact I have some competence already.
2.	Business experience: this packs a punch that looks to condense my diverse career so far into a single powerful sentence that is relevant to the target users.
3.	Key strength: this focuses on one key personal strength, by saying a similar thing in three different ways. This is a technique to reinforce a single point strongly, and this is my biggest personal strength. I feel this is more powerful than listing buzzwords that anyone can list but have all but lost meaning to recruiters. Finally, I back this up with an invite to call me immediately. The goal here is to set myself aside from recent tech graduates who may have a higher technical skillset on paper, but fewer business/social skills, which is something I’ve learned is an issue from speaking to tech recruiters directly at Newcastle’s Tech Talent event in 2019.
4.	Values-based CTA: this shows that I’m considered when it comes to my work, that I’m not just looking for the highest bidder, which is a recipe for high turnover as other positions become available in competing companies, but instead that my drive is around strong values. If a user shares these values, this would be a difficult CTA to completely overlook.

The teaser for this section is: “see my history”. This is intentionally less enticing than previously, as I don’t want to distract too much from the CTA just above it.

### **History**
The history section has three unique elements: the heading, the timeline, and the work/education information.

The heading is again clear and concise but also a little colloquial: “How I got here.” This is to blend professionalism with personality as mentioned above.

The timeline is a logical representation of my employment history. Icons are used to attach meaning to each role and add metaphorical value to the user so they can quickly classify my previous positions. 

The work/education information is broken into four sections:
1.	The dates I worked for/studied at each organisation
2.	The organisation’s name
3.	The role/qualification
4.	My key responsibilities/achievements

The teaser for this section is: “check my skills”. This continues with the personable tone as the user settles into the website and familiarity can increase slightly, while still maintaining conciseness and clarity.

### **Skills**
The skills section has four unique elements: the heading, key skills, programming, and tools.

The heading continues in the same tone: “What I can do.”

The key skills section is a high-level view of what I can do. This is valuable to recruiters and employers according to my private employment coach who tailored my CV in 2019. Again, an icon is used to enhance aesthetic and to add metaphorical benefit.

The programming section is a commonly used bar graph that highlights the level of competence I have for each of the specific skills. This has been done in ascending order from the highest to lowest to allow repeat visitors, if they so wish, to see how my focus and skillset changes.

The tools section showcases my familiarity regarding a range of tools that are relevant to the field. Again, icons play on metaphorical psychology.

The teaser for this section is: “view my work”, continuing in the same clear, friendly but professional tone.

### **Projects**
The skills section has three unique elements: the main heading, the sub-headings, and the projects.

The heading continues in the same tone: “Recent Projects.” Recent is used as not all projects will be added, just those that add value.

The sub-headings distinguish between projects that are in progress, and those that were completed in 2021. Additional years will populate as time goes by.

The projects are in their own accented box and contain:
- A screenshot of the project
- The project type and customer name
- A short outline of the project
- Relevant links to the project, including the live site, GitHub and the wireframes

The tools section showcases my familiarity regarding a range of tools that are relevant to the field. Again, icons play on metaphorical psychology.

The teaser for this section is: “view my work”, continuing in the same clear, friendly but professional tone.

### **Contact**
The contact section has four unique elements: the contact form, the CV download, the additional contact methods, and the social media links.

The contact form is relatively basic and follows convention. This allows minimum friction between users and contact.

The option to download a CV is added here instead of higher in the site as preferentially this is an addition to the site, not a replacement for it.

The additional contact methods are again to ensure minimal friction. There’s an argument that by providing multiple channels you can give the user too many options, and therefore cause friction. I believe that this friction is worth the trade-off to allow recruiters and employers the option to email me directly and to call me, two options I have personally preferred when I have recruited in the past.

The social media links are repeated again here in the same order. This is important, as I expect more people are likely to connect with me on social media after having read the site than before.

### **Footer**
As a nod to collaboration and open-source I’ve left this without copyright. The basic nature of the site means this is a safe enough option in this case.

-----------------------------

## <center>Development, Responsiveness & Accessibility</center>

-----------------------------
The development was done in three stages. First, the site was built section-by-section using a mobile-first approach based on the smallest main breakpoint outlined below (under 576px). Second, the necessary steps were taken to ensure compatibility with a range of screen sizes. Third, amendments and additions were made to ensure accessibility for a range of viewing approaches. This section outlines these three steps in turn.

### **Initial Development**
The following is a series of notes that explain any development-related issues on the first development run, as well as any deviation from convention. The first run was done with the smallest typical screen size in mind, a portrait mobile phone (under 585px). To develop this, 

#### *Navigation*
The navigation bar utilised bootstrap’s feature set, however, I deleted as much as I could while retaining its core functionality to ensure minimalistic code. The menu wasn’t encapsulated in an unordered list format, breaking relatively rigorous convention, I am aware. The Bootstrap site highlighted this was [acceptable](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/navs/) and another [interesting article](https://css-tricks.com/navigation-in-lists-to-be-or-not-to-be/) I found made the case for removing the list feature from all navigation based on accessibility. Due to this, and in keeping with the ‘philosophy’ of the site (and development as a whole) in the fact that minimalistic code that serves the full purpose is both faster to run and easier to maintain, these were then omitted.

In addition, the original mock-up called for a sticky menu bar that changed colour as it passed over different sections to contrast with the sections. After deliberation and acknowledging the limitations of strictly using CSS/HTML, I made an executive decision to omit this feature until I was able to implement the solution competently myself using JavaScript. I toyed with the idea of adding individual menus to each page in the same way as the mock-ups but thought this wasn’t necessary as it is too unconventional and could take more from the site than it gives.

I used the Unicode for the hamburger icon and Font Awesome chevrons were used for the teaser navigation at the bottom of each page.

#### *Home*
The layout of the home page presented some problems on first run due to the smallest screen including devices ranging from tiny portrait mobiles under 300px to small tablets up to 575px, which meant the content was never perfectly aligned across this range. So, designing the site ‘mobile-first’ still required media queries on the first run to ensure it was viable for this smaller range of screens. To do this, I used some media query padding and removed the image for super-small screens as a ‘quick fix’ but improved this during the responsiveness run, as outlined below in the responsiveness section.

The image on the home page was designed using Canva and is more suited to a CV site than the one in the mock-ups. The coloured border was added in Canva, which is sub-optimal since the flexibility to change this within the code would allow more control for future amendments, but Canva would not allow the export of circular images. The image, then, is square with the illusion of circularity due to matching the background colours exactly. Time constraints meant fixing this was not a priority for initial release.
 
#### *Pitch*
The pitch section utilised a simple format of alternating paragraphs with icons. I couldn’t find suitable icons that contained an elevator with both a man and woman in, something I think is important. So, I used Canva to create one, and since I was already creating the icon, I thought it was a good opportunity to tailor it for the site.
 
#### *History*
The history section was similar in nature to the pitch section with icons and text alternating. At this point, a decision was made not to include the timeline from original mock-ups. This would have meant two successive sections with a very similar appearance and for such a simple site, that wasn’t desired. Instead, I decided the dates gave indication of the inferred timeline, and instead using Bootstrap’s grid feature would allow this to expand on larger screens. 
I used ICONSFLOW to source the icons here as the Font Awesome library was limited, and imported the downloaded SVG files.
 
#### *Skills*
The key skills and tools sections were again just headings with paragraphs in keeping with the design of the site. I added slashes instead of commas to add an element of design that was simple to incorporate. I also took the decision here to lay the two text boxes first before the programming bar chart. Since the following projects page looks similar, the programming bar chart breaks this up somewhat.
 
The programming skills progress bar chart was taken from [Camila Carrera on CodePen](https://codepen.io/milacarrera/pen/pEPoZz). I adapted the code to suit the theme of my site, but I thought the aesthetics of it were improved over the original mock-ups and so utilised this.
 
#### *Projects*
During development of the projects page, a random guttering appeared to the right of the elements in the Gitpod viewer. This was distorting the project element width as Bootstrap was taking it into account as part of its 12-section row, but only for this section. I couldn’t find the cause after disabling pretty much everything I could think it might be. In the end, the code below was [found on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4617872/white-space-showing-up-on-right-side-of-page-when-background-image-should-extend) and turned out to fix the problem completely.
html, body

    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 0px;
    overflow-x: hidden; 

 
#### *Contact*
The contact section utilised a very basic contact form and submit button. Due to no database set-up this is non-functional, however, functionality will be added in the future.
 
#### *Footer*
I added a basic footer with a no copyright message and an icon emoji from ICONSFLOW that I may use as a sort of signature on future developments, colouring the icon to suit the theme of each page. After development, I deleted the ‘help yourself’ text as I felt this was unprofessional and superfluous.
 

### **Responsiveness**
From inception to development, the site has been designed using a mobile-first approach. The main breakpoints I have chosen, to ensure that the content remains well-presented on all available screen sizes, are based on Bootstrap’s breakpoints. This was to ensure I could utilise the simplicity of the in-built breakpoints within Bootstrap’s grid system when designing and therefore minimize the need for additional media queries.

These breakpoints are:
- 576px
- 768px
- 992px
- 1200px

This results in the following screen sizes (taken from Bootstrap):
- Extra-small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px) [DEFAULT]
- Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
- Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
- Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
- Extra-large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)

In spite of this efficient solution, and as mentioned above, there was still the need to add a small number of media queries to allow for awkward-appearing screen sizes. These, alongside the breakpoint changes implemented for each screen size, are detailed here section by section.

#### *Navigation*
The navigation menu utilises a hamburger icon (Unicode used) with a standard Bootstrap breakpoint at 768px. I added some padding to the social media icons at this point to ensure they aligned well with the menu links and increased the text size of the main menu at 992px to suit larger screen sizes.

#### *Home*
The content on the home page includes a welcome message on the first row, then an attention-grab text and an image in two columns. Since the landing page is the first thing users see, I spent a little time ensuring no matter the screen size, this looked right. To do this, I used max-width media queries at 350px and 400px to control padding and where text breaks for the smaller screen size range, and a series of min-width media queries for higher screen sizes.

I also reversed the order of the columns and adjusted their sizes so they would stack nicely with the image above the text on smaller screens. I got the insight for the simplicity of this solution from [J Fiddle on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33082796/how-to-reverse-the-order-of-elements-in-media-queries)

Originally, I had planned for the image to disappear on smaller devices, but since it is the only image on the site, and since recruiters like to see what potential employers look like, I decided losing this wasn’t acceptable.

     

#### *Pitch*
The pitch section is based on the idea of an elevator going down. As such the content needed to remain centred and not spread out. I used Bootstrap’s default column settings (shown below) and some padding to achieve this:

    col-10 col-md-8 col-lg-6

This meant as the screen grew, the portion of the screen each column took up would shrink and avoided the need for any media queries.


#### *History*
Since the timeline was not going to be utilised, this made the history section flexible to spread into multiple columns for larger screen sizes. Again, Bootstrap’s inbuilt grad system was leveraged to avoid the need for any media queries:

    col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4

This meant the default column with would take full screen (mobile-first), then two columns would appear for medium screens (over 768px) and three columns for large screens (over 992px). With six items in the list, this worked nicely. Finally, I used a container for this section to ensure the content did not reach the edges. 

#### *Skills*
The skills section also took advantage of Bootstrap’s grid functionality:

    col-8 col-md-5

Here, the two skills boxes only take up 8/12 of the screen ensuring centred content, and then they align side-by-side on medium screens. I’ve used md-5 to allow for a margin between the boxes which is built into the CSS.

The programming bar chart utilised bootstrap in the simplest way:

    col-8

This ensured that for all screen sizes, this element would only take up 8/12 of the screen.
 
#### *Projects*
Again, the projects section utilised Bootstrap:

    col-8 col-sm-5 col-md-3

As above, this allowed for margins to be left between the items while allowing for three different formats: a single column on small screens, two columns on medium screens and three columns on larger screens.

This looks relatively blank right now, but in time this will of course fill up.
 

#### *Contact*
Finally, the contact form also used Bootstrap to adjust size at the relevant breakpoints:

    col-10 col-md-9 col-lg-8 col-xl-7

Here, the proportion of the screen allocated to the form reduces as the screen size increases to ensure the form doesn’t stretch too far across the screen.

### **Accessibility**
The following accessibility considerations are based on the best ‘checklist’ I could find, designed by Aaron Cannon, a blind web developer and accessibility consultant. Aaron isn’t a fan of accessibility checklists, and I find the best work is often done by those critical of the current status quo. The checklist is in the credits section at the end.

#### *Mark-up*
- Structure and presentation are separated, with zero in-line CSS used in the HTML document which can affect screen-readers.
- The primary language (English) is outlined in the HTML head using the lang attribute.
- Proper mark-up has been used for each element type, such as sections, headings, paragraphs, etc.
- Headings are used in correct order without skipping any in the hierarchy and H1 is only used once.
- The page title is meaningful and accurate.
- Skip to main has been implemented before the navigation section. The code was adapted from [NC State University's accessibility guidelines](https://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/it-accessibility-at-nc-state/developers/accessibility-handbook/mouse-and-keyboard-events/skip-to-main-content/).

## <center>Testing & Bugs</center>

-----------------------------
The website was tested from various angles: code, user perspectives, functionality and responsiveness/accessibility.

### **Testing Code**
The code was ran through multiple code validators. This resulted in minor adjustments before repeating the process. The validators and results are as follows:
- [W3C Markup Validator](http://validator.w3.org): Pass no errors 
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/): Pass no errors
- [Rakko HTML5 validator](https://en.rakko.tools/tools/58/): Pass no errors
- [W3C Link checker](https://validator.w3.org/checklink): Pass no errors

### **Testing User Stories**
The site’s **primary users**, employers and recruiters, will want:

1.	To be able to easily navigate around the site.
> This is achieved via a preferred and directed navigation method of using the arrows to flow through the single page site. Additionally, there is a conventional navigation menu, alongside responsive design and accessibility measures.

2.	To understand immediately and with definitive clarity the purpose of the site and its relevance to them in their search for talent.
> This is achieved on the opening page by way of welcome text outlining that the site is my CV, and subsequently the fact I am a full stack developer seeking employment. Zero ambiguity.

3.	To get a glimpse of my personality and what I can bring to the table.
> My life philosophy, my pitch, including my core strengths and values, and the clarity of the copy all provide this information without potentially boring the user or losing the air of professionality that is also important.

4.	To obtain key information about me, specifically:
- My education/work history.
- My current skillset with competence levels where applicable.
- The projects I have worked on.
> Each of these elements have their own designated section, and are aesthetically presented using appealing, metaphorical icons, outline boxes and bar charts, while still keeping the information itself concise throughout.

5.	To be able to contact me in their preferred manner.
> There is a dedicated page for contacting me, including via essentially eight channels: contact form, telephone, email, and five social media channels.

6.	To be able to download a copy of my CV to share with their organisation or network.
> Finally, the CV download is clear and simple on the final page, and is in PDF, a cross-platform and widely accessible format.

The site’s **secondary users**, collaborators, will want:

1.	To be able to easily navigate around the site.
> This is again achieved via a preferred and directed navigation method of using the arrows to flow through the single page site. Additionally, there is a conventional navigation menu, alongside responsive design and accessibility measures.

2.	To understand immediately and with definitive clarity the purpose of the site and its relevance to them in their search for collaborators.
> This is achieved on the opening page by way of welcome text outlining that the site is my CV, and subsequently the fact I am a full stack developer seeking collaboration. Zero ambiguity.

3.	To get a glimpse of my personality and what my values are.
> My life philosophy and my core values are provided.

4.	To obtain key information about me, specifically:
- My current skillset with competence levels where applicable.
- The projects I have worked on and the briefs I have worked to in these projects.
> Both of these elements have their own section, and front and centre of each project there is a single sentence brief.

5.	To be able to contact me in their preferred manner.
> There is a dedicated page for contacting me, including via essentially eight channels: contact form, telephone, email, and via five social media channels.

Return visitors will want to:
1.	Quickly locate and view my updated projects.
> The order of the projects ensures this is easily achieved.

2.	Quickly assess my competence levels in key areas.
> The skills bar chart and the ordered nature of it, from highest to lower, ensures this can be easily achieved.

### **Testing Functionality**
I tested the functionality of the site by completing the following tests:
- I tried all links
    - Off-site links open in a new browser
- On-site navigation links work properly
    - I tested the website on the three most-used browsers.
- Safari
- Chrome
- FireFox
    - I tested the contact form to ensure it was working properly.
- Any missing info returns an error message.
- An incorrect email format returns an error message.
- The correct info doesn’t do anything yet as the backend isn’t configured. (To be updated.)

### **Testing Accessibility & Responsiveness**
- I tried this on a range of screens:
    - An iPhone 5 with a 4” screen
    - An iPhone XS with a 5.8” screen
    - A small tablet (TBC – DAD)
    - An iPad Pro with a 10.5” screen
    - A MacBook Pro with a 13” screen
    - A 50” LG TV (For fun)
- The site was tested for accessibility use the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool. The results can be [seen here](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://trdownie.github.io/ucd-cv-website/)

-----------------------------

## <center>Limitations & Improvements</center>

-----------------------------

Limitations due to competence level or time constraints are outlined here, followed by suggested future improvements.

### **Current Limitations**
#### *Navigation Bar*
The navigation bar isn’t fixed to the screen to travel with the flow of the page. This is generally a good idea when using a long continuous scroll, but I decided against it here. Utilising Bootstrap’s built-in fixed navbar functionality is very simple and can be done using fixed-top or sticky-top classes depending on preference. The problem is, this functionality has two limitations. First, the hamburger menu doesn’t automatically collapse after selecting an item. This requires additional JavaScript. Therefore, users would have to click the hamburger icon a second time to close the menu. Second, the active ID I have used for the home screen would not change as the menu scrolled through different sections, again, without adding additional JavaScript. These two limitations mean the menu wouldn’t meet the user’s expectations and this is not acceptable. Instead, having a fixed menu at the top is the best option without using JavaScript. This isn’t completely terrible, since it means the user is forced to follow the flow of the page and puts more emphasis on the desired navigation structure using the teaser text and down arrows.

#### *Landing Page*
The landing page doesn’t flex to fill the screen on all devices, instead it is set to have a minimum height of the viewport but can extend beyond this. This was necessary to ensure the heading, attention grab, image and teaser all remained optimum size on the home page on smaller screens. This takes away slightly from the user experience, therefore at a future date I will adjust this.

#### *Contact Form*
The contact form is not connected to a database system; therefore, it is non-functional.

#### *CV Download*
The CV download is an old CV. This will be updated before applying for positions.

### **Future Improvements**

#### *Navigation*
At a future date I will make the menu bar into a sticky using JS, and also use alternative colours for each sections as per mock-ups.

#### *GIF Photograph*
I may change the photo on the home page to a GIF of me smiling. This is a little gimmicky, so I haven’t added this yet and instead will wait until I get some professional feedback on the site.

#### *Video Pitch*
When barber shops and office blocks are open again, I will add a video elevator pitch option above the elevator pitch as a nice little alternative for the pitch section. This will be me in an actual elevator putting across the pitch that is on screen so that users can see me in action and get a feel for my passion and what I am trying to convey.

#### *Interactive Pitch*
Once I have the competence, I will change the elevator icons and associated text to load in continuous flow as the user scrolls down to mimic an elevator.

#### *Scope*
At a future date, when I begin freelancing, I may split the site into two versions, one for recruiters and one for clients, with a master landing page that asks which the user is. The colour scheme will invert completely for clients, the pitch page will revolve more around addressing client needs in a specific niche, the history page will be replaced by testimonials, and the skills page will be replaced by specific, relevant offerings, such as ‘website design’.

#### *Interactivity*
At some future point, and dependant on recruiter and employer feedback, I may add niche interactive elements in a bid to be bold and stand out in an ever-crowded field.
